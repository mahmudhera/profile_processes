# profile_processes
In this repo, we are writing a piece of code that will:

- Monitor the list of all processes
- Whenever a new process belonging to current user is spawned, we will keep track of it
- We will record the running time, cpu usages etc.

We will change the behavior accordingly as we see fit.
